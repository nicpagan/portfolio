            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>After graduating from college and landing a few administrative roles, I found myself longing for a career where I could express my creativity, work collaboratively, and be challenged every day.</p>
            <p>With a strong interest in computers, a creative mind, and the drive to always learn new things, a friend recommended that web development may be just the thing I was looking for. After some initial research and self-studying, I found that I really enjoyed building websites and creating fun projects through coding.</p>
            <p>I have now begun my journey to becoming a software developer by becoming a student at <a href='https://www.thinkful.com/'>Thinkful</a>, and I am so excited begin!</p>
            <p>If you are looking to hire a developer or collaborate on projects together, please feel free reach out and contact me. I would love the opportunity to build software and connect with developers. </p>
